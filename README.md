# 🧮 Employee Salary Raise Calculator  

My first Python program to calculate salary raise based on employee experience.  
It might look simple, but it's **special for me** — because it’s my **Day 2 of learning Python!** 💪  

## 📋 About
This project takes employee details like name, age, branch, experience, and salary,  
then automatically calculates if they deserve a salary raise.

## ⚙️ Features
- Input employee details  
- Logic-based salary raise using `if-elif` conditions  
- Clean and formatted output  
- Beginner-friendly syntax  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.  
2. Save this file as `salary_checker.py`  
3. Open terminal in the same folder and type:
   ```bash
   python salary_checker.py

🧠 Example

Input:

WELCOME ! TO EMPLOYEE SALARY INCREASE FESTIVAL !
ENTER YOUR NAME: RUDRA
ENTER EXPERIENCE: 6
ENTER SALARY: 30000


Output:

CONGRATS ! YOU HAVE +3000 SALARY
NEW SALARY: $33000

🌱 My Journey

I’m just starting out — this is my first real Python project,
and I’ll keep building better, smarter programs every single day. 🚀
